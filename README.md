# An Introduction to relational databases

## Introduction

In it's simplest form, a relational database is a mechanism to store and retrieve data in a tabular form.

Spread sheets are a good analogy.  Individual sheets as tables and the whole spreadsheet as a database.  Please follow**[this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11oSk85me0klRDfa6o7OfkzMVnvOuhxsF9W-bQEPP5wk/edit?usp=sharing)** for an example.
